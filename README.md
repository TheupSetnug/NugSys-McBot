# NugSys McBot
Hi there! We are the Nugget System, a collection of identies that share a body. We are currently working on a Discord bot to help DID and OSDD systems better manage themselves and provide resources for themselves internally through a community platform that is easy to adopt for most people.

This bot is currently in development and is not ready for use. If you would like to contribute, please contact me on Discord at "upsetnuggets".

We are very new to coding and are using this as a way to further our skills, and hope that through it we can make something to give back to the community.
Currently, our strengths are in Python, but are open to learning new things to add to this if it gets enough traction.
Please excuse any noob errors we make, and feel free to point them out to us so we can learn from them.

# Vision
As a system ourselves, we find that oftentimes its difficult to manage all the complexities of life and the system. We want to make a bot that can help with that.
- Reminders
- Scheduling
- Internal communication
- Outsider Communication
- Internal resource management
- Private Alter Spaces
- Internal Voting
- System Rules
- Alter Roles
- Parts Journaling (for those who do that)
- A way to keep track of who is fronting
- Google Drive and Calendar integration
- PluralKit integration
- Maybe a web dashboard
- who knows what else

Of course PluralKit already exists, but we want to make something that is more tailored to the needs of systems, and is more accessible to those who are not as tech savvy (or hopefully have one person in the system who is tech savvy enough to set it up for everyone else). We also want to make it so that it is more private, and not reliant on a third party service. Privacy and security are very important to us, and we want to make sure that this bot is as secure as possible, especially since it will be handling private system information.

# Current Features
